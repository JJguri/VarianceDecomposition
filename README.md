## Variance Decomposition

### Functionality

Calculate the *_Main Effect (ME)_* and the *_Total Effect (TE)_* 
of a series of factors on crop yield variability.

### Description

ME explains the share of the components to crop yield variability 
without interactions, i.e. if _ME=1_, the assessed factors explain 
the entire proportion of crop yield variability, but if _M<1_, residuals
exist which means additional factors are required to explain this variability. TE represents the 
interaction of a given factor with other factors, i.e. high TE values 
for a given factor denote high interactions of that factor with other 
factors, therefore, TE does not include residuals.
